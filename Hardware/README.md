# Hardware
Consists of Two Parts
* Electrical System
* Mechanical System

In this project there are 3 degrees of 
freedom, so if we want to move to a 
point in the vacuum then we must use 
3 motors to achieve this point in 
addition to a fourth motor to control 
the gripper.
So, we have to go through the 
mechanical design first, then the 
electrical design, and then combine 
them together.

## Mechanical System

Choosing the dimensions and the 
number of joints in the arm, which is 
one of the very important things, so 
the design must be studied well, 
taking into account the strong 
momentum affecting the arm in the 
sleep mode and also the force 
affecting it in the motion position, so 
we used a ready-made 3D design.
